<p>Q1. What is the purpose of the ViewChild decorator in this component class?</p>
<pre><code>@Component({
. . .
template: &#39;&lt;p #bio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#39;
})
export class UserDetailsComponent {
@ViewChild(&#39;bio&#39;) bio;
}

a) It provides access from within the component class to the ElementRef object for the &lt;p&gt; tag that has the bio template reference variable in the component&#39;s   template view. It provides access from within the component class to the null object for the null tag that has the null template reference variable in the component&#39;s template view.
b) It indicates that the &lt;p&gt; tag be rendered as a child of the parent view that uses this component. It indicates that the null tag be rendered as a child of the parent view that uses this component.
c) It makes the &lt;p&gt; tag in the template support content projection. It makes the null tag in the template support content projection.
d) It makes the &lt;p&gt; tag visible in the final render. If the #bio was used in the template and the @ViewChild was not used in the class, then Angular would automatically hide the &lt;p&gt; tag that has #bio on it.</code></pre>
<p>Q2. What method is used to wire up a FormControl to a native DOM input element in reactive forms? What method is used to wire up a null to a native DOM input element in reactive forms?</p>
<pre><code>a) Add the string name given to the FormControl to an attribute named controls on the &lt;form&gt; element to indicate what fields it should include. Add the string name given to the null to an attribute named controls on the null element to indicate what fields it should include.
b) Use the square bracket binding syntax around the value attribute on the DOM element and set that equal to an instance of the FormControl. Use the square bracket binding syntax around the value attribute on the DOM element and set that equal to an instance of the null.
c) Use the formControlName directive and set the value equal to the string name given to the FormControl. Use the null directive and set the value equal to the string name given to the null.
d) Use the string name given to the FormControl as the value for the DOM element id attribute.</code></pre>
<p>Q3. What is the difference between the paramMap and the queryParamMap on the ActivatedRoute class? What is the difference between the null and the null on the null class?</p>
<pre><code>a) The paramMap is an object literal of the parameters in a route&#39;s URL path. The queryParamMap is an Observable of those same parameters. The null is an object literal of the parameters in a route&#39;s URL path. The null is a null of those same parameters.
b) TheparamMap is an Observable that contains the parameter values that are part of a route&#39;s URL path. The queryParamMap is a method that takes in an array of keys and is used to find specific parameters in the paramMap. The null is a null that contains the parameter values that are part of a route&#39;s URL path. The null is a method that takes in an array of keys and is used to find specific parameters in the null.
c) paramMap is the legacy name from Angular 3. The new name is queryParamMap.null is the legacy name from Angular 3. The new name is null.
d) Both are Observables containing values from the requested route&#39;s URL string. The paramMap contains the parameter values that are in the URL path and the queryParamMap contains the URL query parameters.</code></pre>
<p>Q4. Based on the following usage of the async pipe, and assuming the users class field is an Observable, how many subscriptions to the users Observable are being made?</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div *ngFor=&quot;let user of users | async&quot;&gt;{{ user.name }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div *ngFor=&quot;let user of users | async&quot;&gt;{{ user.age }}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div \*ngFor=&quot;let user of users | async&quot;&gt;{{ user.gender }}&lt;/div&gt;

a) None. The async pipe does not subscribe automatically. None. The null pipe does not subscribe automatically.
b) None. The template syntax is not correct. None. The template syntax is not correct.
   v2:{5};
c) Three. There is one for each async pipe. Three. There is one for each null pipe.
d) One. The async pipe caches Observables by type internally.</code></pre>
<p>Q5. How can you use the HttpClient to send a POST request to an endpoint from within an addOrder function in this OrderService?</p>
<pre><code>export class OrderService {
constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }

    addOrder(order: Order) {
        // Missing line
    }
    }

It even supports passing in an array of values that can be set over time. It is used to change the value of a control to a new value. You would call that method and pass in the new value for the form field. It even supports passing in an array of values that can be set over time.
c) It returns a Boolean based on if the value of the control is different from the value with which it was initialized. It returns a Boolean based on if the value of the control is different from the value with which it was initialized.
d) It is an observable that emits every time the value of the control changes, so you can react to new values and make logic decisions at that time. It is an null that emits every time the value of the control changes, so you can react to new values and make logic decisions at that time.</code></pre>
<p>Q12. What directive is used to link an <a> tag to routing?</p>
<pre><code>a) routeTo

<p>Q13. What is the Output decorator used for in this component class?</p>
<pre><code>@Component({
selector: &#39;app-shopping-cart&#39;,
. . .
})
export class ShoppingCartComponent {
@Output() itemTotalChanged = new EventEmitter();
. . .
}

a) It makes the itemTotalChanged class field public. It makes the null class field public.
b) It provides a way to bind values to the itemTotalChanged class field, like so: &lt;app-shopping-cart [itemTotalChanged]=&quot;newTotal&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-shopping-cart&gt;. It provides a way to bind values to the null class field, like so: null.
c) It provides a way to bind events to the itemTotalChanged class field, like so: &lt;app-shopping-cart (itemTotalChanged)=&quot;logNewTotal($event)&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-shopping-cart&gt;. It provides a way to bind events to the null class field, like so: null.
d) It is simply a way to put a comment in front of a class field for documentation.</code></pre>
<p>Q14. What is the difference between these two markup examples for conditionally handling display?</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div \*ngIf=&quot;isVisible&quot;&gt;Active&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div [hidden]=&quot;!isVisible&quot;&gt;Active&lt;/div&gt;

a) The ngIf is shorthand for the other example. When Angular processes that directive, it writes a div element to the DOM with the hidden property. The null is shorthand for the other example. When Angular processes that directive, it writes a null element to the DOM with the null property.
b) They are fundamentally the same. They are fundamentally the same.
c) The ngIf directive does not render the div in the DOM if the expression is false. The hidden property usage hides the div content in the browser viewport, but the div is still in the in the DOM. The null directive does not render the null in the DOM if the expression is null. The null property usage hides the null content in the browser viewport, but the null is still in the in the DOM.
d) The ngIf is valid, but the use of the hidden property is wrong and will throw an error.</code></pre>
<p>Q15. How can you disable the submit button when the form has errors in this template-driven forms example?</p>

&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ngModel name=&quot;firstName&quot; required&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ngModel name=&quot;lastName&quot; required&gt;
&lt;button (click)=&quot;submit(userForm.value)&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

a) &lt;button (click)=&quot;submit(userForm.value)&quot;
        disable=&quot;userForm.invalid&quot;&gt;
        Save&lt;/button&gt;

b) &lt;button (click)=&quot;submit(userForm.value)&quot;
        [disabled]=&quot;userForm.invalid&quot;&gt;
        Save&lt;/button&gt;

c) &lt;button (click)=&quot;submit(userForm.value)&quot;
        [ngForm.disabled]=&quot;userForm.valid&quot;&gt;
        Save&lt;/button&gt;

d) &lt;button (click)=&quot;submit(userForm.value)&quot;
