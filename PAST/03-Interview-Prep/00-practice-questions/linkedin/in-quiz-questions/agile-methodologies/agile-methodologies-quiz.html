</ul>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>
<p>Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is a prioritization model used to sequence jobs (eg., Features, Capabilities, and Epics) to produce the maximum economic benefit. In a flow-based system, priorities are updated continuously to provide the best economic outcomes. Job sequencing, rather than individual job return on investment, produces the best result. To that end, WSJF is used to prioritize backlogs by calculating the relative CoD and job size (a proxy for the duration). <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/">(Source)</a></p>

<li>[ ] high-value and low-risk</li>
<li>[ ] low-value and low-risk</li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>
<p>It is suggested that high business value, high-risk items are worked on first. While that may seem counterintuitive, the earlier this work is done, the sooner the team will move to mitigate the issues and unknowns—leading to a higher quality product. If there’s a failure, it will occur early and relatively inexpensively. <a href="https://agilescrumguide.com/blog/files/tag-product-backlog---business-value-and-risk.html">(Source)</a></p>
