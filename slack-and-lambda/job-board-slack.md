Hey Everyone!A recruiter friend of mine is looking to fill a couple of positions at a well funded SaaS. One is a front end position with Angular JS (latest version) The back end position is a PHP role, but they are also okay with devs who know Python or .Net and are okay transitioning to PHP.They're labeling these mid-level roles, but there might be some flexibility depending on the candidate. They're asking for 3-5 years exp. Prior SaaS experience is a huge plus. Salary is in the 120k range. Both positions are remote now due to COVID, but will be hybrid when things reopen. Looking for people in Raleigh, Ann Arbor, Phoenix, or Bellevue.DM me if you're interested and I can introduce/connect you with my friend.Tuesday, October 19th![](https://ca.slack-edge.com/ESZCHB482-W016369SB7T-60addc1c9d37-48)[Jennifer Stewart](https://app.slack.com/team/W016369SB7T)  [4:00 PM](https://lambda-students.slack.com/archives/C9T15LTUY/p1634673650137600)\

My company could be looking to fill a full stack web position soon. We do consultancy for other companies and are currently investing in some cool ML tech of our own. We work heavily with React and Typescript on FE. Django and rest framework on BE. Docker experience would be a big plus. If you or anyone you know sounds like a good fit, please reach out!Yesterday
