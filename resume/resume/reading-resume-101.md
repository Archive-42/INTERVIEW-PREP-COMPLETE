# Resume 101

As you are aware, getting your foot into the door of any company for an
interview is no easy task.  No matter whether you have an “in” with someone at
the company or are cold applying, the first thing they are going to do is “check
you out” through your resume.

Your resume is your doc telling potential employers your #experience and
#knowledge in a format that is easy to read and showcases you as a Software
Engineer.  A startling fact is that, on average, a typical recruiter might check
out your resume FOR ONLY 6 SECONDS!  That is not a great deal of time.  So,
within the first few moments, your resume needs to show you are a technical and
knowledgeable candidate.

Over the next few months, we will be working with you to create an awesome
resume that will help you to get noticed by potential employers.  However,
before we get started, there are some things you need to know.


## APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEMS (ATS)

As per www.JobScan.com:

> An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a piece of software used by companies to
> assist with human resources, recruitment, and hiring needs. While each system
> offers a different package of features, applicant tracking systems are
> primarily used to help hiring companies organize and navigate large numbers of
> applicants.

### What is an Applicant Tracking System?

> Applicant tracking systems are used by corporations to assist with recruitment
> and hiring processes. Each system offers a different combination and scope of
> features, but ATS are primarily used to help hiring companies collect,
> organize, and filter applicants.  Job seekers who submit their resume and job
> application through an online form are interacting with an ATS.

### Why Do Companies Use Applicant Tracking Systems?

The relative ease of submitting an online job application has created a
challenge for hiring companies. Online job postings can elicit hundreds of
applications, many of which are from unqualified job seekers who figured “it was
worth a try.” Instead of sorting through a stack of paper resumes or crowded
email inbox, recruiters and hiring managers use ATS to keep themselves organized
and efficient. This solution is especially critical for larger companies that
are hiring for multiple positions and departments simultaneously.

Among other features, ATS offer CRM-style tools to help streamline hiring
pipelines, communication with applicants, distribution of job postings, and
proof of government compliance for things like the EEOC.

### Why Are Applicant Tracking Systems a Problem for Job Seekers?

Corporate recruiters can have their ATS automatically extract information from
an applicant’s resume to build a digital applicant profile that can be searched,
filtered, and/or ranked. The goal is to quickly cull out anyone who is
under-qualified, make the applicant pool smaller, and quickly identify the top
candidates.

Unfortunately for job seekers, most ATS lack sophistication and are not able to
search and filter candidates reliably. Some highly qualified candidates fall
through the cracks and are wrongfully eliminated from the applicant pool because
their resume has formatting issues or lacks the correct search keywords.

This is a necessary tradeoff for many hiring professionals with limited time and
resources. In order to get noticed, job seekers must optimize their resume for
ATS.

So, as you will note, ATS are a very serious consideration when it comes down to
your resume format and content.

## RESUME FORMAT

Over the years, we have learned that resumes that go through an ATS need to be
in a “parseable” format.  While there are many schools of thought when it comes
to formatting and what is “parseable”, here at App Academy, we believe very
strongly in keeping your resume in a very easy-to-read simple format.

Please use one of the templates from our library. Copy and create your own
resume from the link [online resume templates][1]

## WHY WE KNOW THESE WORK

While not glamorous, we do know the following about our templates:

1. Resume fonts are Google safe and should make it through an ATS
2. There are no icons or pictures which can get your resume booted from an ATS
3. There are no columns.  While some believe you can have columns on your
   resume, we know that certain systems will knock out these resumes.  Also,
   columns take up a great deal of real estate

Using our templates, you will have more room to showcase your technical and
previous experience.

## WHAT MAKES A GOOD FORMAT

We believe a well formatted resume contains the following:

* Resumes need to be ONE PAGE ONLY
* Margins are .5 - 1.0 top/bottom/sides
* Content is single spaced
* Fonts are between 9.5 -12 in size depending on the height/width of the font.  Of course, definitely make sure all fonts are Google safe for ATS search.  Keeping fonts in the simplest formats (Arial/Helvetica, Times New Roman, Courier, Garamond, etc) is always a good practice
* There is ample white space between resume sections (ie.  Skills, Projects, Experience, Education)
* At the top of your resume you should have the following:
  * Name
  * Phone
  * Email
  * City / State (optional)
  * Addresses are NOT required these days
  * LinkedIn (with link inserted)
  * Github (with link inserted)
  * Portfolio (you will be creating a portfolio site.  Link needs to be inserted)
* Each project should have the following:  Live | Github
  * You will provide a live link to each project when they are completed
  * You will provide a live link to your final project README on Github
* PLEASE SAVE YOUR RESUME AS:  LastName_FirstName_Resume

## RESUME SECTIONS

### NAME (2 font sizes bigger than the body in bold)

Phone, Email, City/State (optional), LinkedIn, Github, Portfolio

### SKILLS

When a tracking system is reviewing a resume, like any search engine, it
will start from the top and go down.  If a recruiter is doing a “6-second scan”
we believe the first thing they should see are your skills, ie.  Python, React,
JavaScript, Node.js, Mongo etc.

*Note:  Do not write "MERN" stack.  Instead, list out each one MongoDB,
Express.js, React, Node.js as a recruiter probably will not search under “MERN”
and will be searching for specific words.

Also, please add spaces for certain technologies.

DON’T WRITE React/Redux.

DO WRITE React (space)/(space) Redux - React / Redux, Ruby / Rails - this helps
during a recruiter search as they are typically searching for keywords only.

### PROJECTS

* Each project should have a name with technologies built in (check out our
  templates for examples)
* Projects can have a very short descriptor (ie.  A visualization website
  dedicated to crime statistics in California)
* Each project must have a link to the site and a link to the project README on
  Github
* Each project should have 3-4 bullet points about what you did as a software
  engineer to make features function.

### EXPERIENCE

* Each position should have the name of the company, your title and dates of
  employment
* Each position should have 2-3 bullets describing SPECIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS
* Each bullet, when possible should be quantifiable (trained 20 people,
  responsible for an annual budget of $1M, reduced costs by 30%)
* If you have prior software development experience, you might want to consider
  placing your EXPERIENCE above your PROJECTS section

### EDUCATION
List your previous educational institution, city/state, degree and dates of
attendance.  For example:

```
University of Amazingness, New York, NY
2012-2016 BA - Mechanical Engineering
```

_App Academy_

Now that you are an App Academy student, selling yourself requires you to sell
employers on the quality of App Academy. In your résumé, mention that App
Academy is a 1000-hour coding school with an admissions rate below 3%, which
emphasizes coding style, pair programming, and best practices.

Here are some suggested bullet points for your resume. Mix and match!

* Rigorous 1000-hour software development course with <3% acceptance rate
* 1000-hour immersive full-stack web development intensive with <3% acceptance
  rate
* Teaches full-stack web development: Python,  SQL, JavaScript, React, TDD,
  algorithms, design patterns, and programming best practices.
* Topics include: TDD, scalability, algorithms, OOP, coding style, REST,
  security, single-page apps, and web development best practices.

  **College** If you took CS-related courses in college, add a "Curriculum
  Highlights" section under the name of your degree and list those courses. Ie.
  Python, Data Structures, Algorithms..

  **No Degree or Relevant Work Experience** Many students have graduated from
  App Academy without a college degree or relevant work experience. They are now
  all employed. It might be tougher to get through the résumé screening, but the
  tech industry is famous for appreciating non-traditional backgrounds.

  The key in this case is to make a strong personal impression. You don't want
  the reader to come away thinking "OK they can code. But I have no idea what
  else to expect from this person." You have to be creative.

* Have you ever done volunteer work?
* Do you have some interesting hobbies that would make you stand out?
* It'll also be important to write enthusiastic cover letters that show an
  interest in what the company does.

If it's the case, you can mention "Left college in good academic standing for
financial reasons / to pursue web development."

### WORK HISTORY:  CREATING BULLET POINTS

Review crafting project bullet points and incorporate action verbs in your
bullets.

The difference between a compelling work history and a boring one is whether you
have identified the results of your work.

Someone who can talk about outcomes is someone who a) made a difference at their
job, b) cares about results, and c) is likely to produce results at their next
job. Quantify or Qualify The difference between: "Wrote financial reports" vs.
"Produced quarterly financial reports, to maintain relationships with 6 major
account holders."

The first is the bare minimum of what was done with no indication of how it was
done or what was accomplished. The second has specific benchmarks and a reason
for why it was done.

Every bullet point should be quantified and/or qualified:

* **Quantify**: Numbers to measure your success. "Delivered pizzas" vs. "Delivered approx. 40 pizzas in each 4-hour shift"
* **Qualify**: Specific reasons for why and how you were successful. "Served dinner" vs. "Wrote a new salad recipe that replaces bacon with cucumbers, to please a health-conscious client."

Simply describing something that sounds like success is a big plus. Consider the following blurbs.

"Wrote scripts to test new product before shipping." vs. "Wrote Bash scripts to
test new product before shipping. Achieved 90% test coverage, resulting in
bug-free launch."

Who knows if that's a meaningful benchmark? Maybe there weren't that many
features. Or maybe the product still had bugs and they just didn't turn up
during the launch. The key here is that you get to frame it. Position yourself
as a winner.

## Quality over Quantity

Describing results takes more space. Two longer bullet points that convey
success are much stronger than four bullet points that only describe process no
matter what portion of your previous job you're leaving out.

## You're an Engineer Now

If you did coding-like technical things, talk about it. Whether that be
scripting, Excel analyses, financial crunching, SQL queries, whatever. Technical
experience helps smooth out the narrative of your transition into engineering.
