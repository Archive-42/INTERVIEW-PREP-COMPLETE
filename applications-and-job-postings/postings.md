**¬ª Why your organization should have a professional website?**

Websites are a key part of a company‚Äôs online presence strategy. It acts as a map that introduces the brand and helps users navigate through the features of the product, reviews on the company, and information on delivery and shipping. Today, open-source content management systems like WordPress have made it easy for anyone to create a website in no time. However, a business organization requires more than just that. Here is why you should invest resources in building a professional website:

**‚Ä∫ Credibility:**

Most consumers prefer to search for products and services on the internet before buying them. A professional website that shows up as soon as they enter the name of your company adds credibility to your brand and product. Without a website, your business might lose a competitive advantage as you have no platform to advertise your strengths.

**‚Ä∫ Cost and time effective:**

Despite the initial cost of designing and developing, a website generally costs less than any other promotional vehicle. It is easy to access and can reach a wide audience. An online catalog can provide lots of information about your product and save the time spent on explaining this to your customers one-on-one. Further, once your website is up and running, it is available indefinitely.

**‚Ä∫ Improve customer base and showcase your work:**

A website performs the dual function of developing customer-engagement while simultaneously advertising your product through portfolios, images, or testimonials. FAQ pages and newsletters can answer all your customers‚Äô questions and keep them up-to-date. What better way to go the extra mile than by sharing valuable and relevant information on your website.

**¬ª Why your organization must choose expert developers and designers to build your website?**

It is impossible to create a top-of-the-line and unique website with these so-called free website templates available online. A website represents the quality of your product and it is important to include images, headers, plugins, and code to ensure that your vision is turned into reality. Without a background in IT or programming, this will prove to be Greek and Latin. However, for professional web development companies, it is all second nature. Further, hiring a web design company will offer your users an attractive and dynamic website with the benefits of customization. The web designer will evaluate your business and products, and work with you towards your goal for the website. Search Engine Optimization techniques and the use of the latest technology for the development and maintenance of your website will make the growth of your business more probable. None of these benefits are offered by the basic cookie-cutter tools online. Thus, hiring a web design and development agency is crucial for the success of your website.

#### The Basics of Website Building:

**¬ª What are the elements required to build a website?**

**‚Ä∫ Navigation**

Easy to navigate web design and accessible menu items are important to ensure that the user always knows exactly where they are on the website. Site maps focused on functionality and interactive buttons are innovative ideas that can improve user experience.

**‚Ä∫ Content**

When it comes to websites, the content is king. Search Engine Optimization determines placement to ensure that your website reaches its maximum target audience. The content must be informative, easy to read, concise and engaging to create an effective website.

**‚Ä∫ Search**

A search tool is vital to ensure that users can quickly find the exact information they are looking for without having to comprehend complicated site maps.

**‚Ä∫ Accessibility**

Based on your target audience, it is important to ensure that your website is available both on desktop and mobile phones. It is also crucial to ensure that key information like contact details and product description is placed in an easily accessible area.

**‚Ä∫ Branding**

Visitors should immediately make a visual connection between your logo, print material, and your website. The website should represent your brand, contribute to the memorability of your branding, and enhance the image of your business.

**¬ª What are the steps for building a website?**

**‚Ä∫ Goal-setting:**

It is important to identify the aims and objectives behind the website. Is the website focused on the brand‚Äôs core message or a particular product with a specific focus? What are the personas of the target audience and the brand attributes? Competitor analysis and creative brief can be great tools to begin goal-setting.

**‚Ä∫ Identifying the scope:**

For the smooth functioning of the process of web development, it is important to collaborate with the experts and identify the core scope and functionalities. If the goal of the website gradually changes or expands through the process of development and design, not only will the final product be increasingly different from the original vision but with budget and time constraints, it will also, become unrealistic.

**‚Ä∫ Sitemap and Wireframe creation:**

A sitemap acts as a blueprint of your website and will give the designer a clear idea of the web architecture and the mutual relationship between the various pages and content elements. The next step is to build a mock-up of the wireframe in order to store the visual design and identify gaps. Balsamiq, Moqups, Sketch, and Axure are popular sitemap and wireframe creation tools used by professionals.

**‚Ä∫ Content and Designing:**

Curating engaging content both in terms of how it is written and how it is presented is the next crucial step. Attention catching phrases presented with the right structural elements serve best. Designing themes can begin with existing branding elements, color choices, and logos. High-quality designing can give a professional look while simultaneously increasing clicks, engagement, and revenue.

**‚Ä∫ Debugging:**

Once the development and designing are completed, it's time to test and debug. This involves ensuring that all pages of the website are loading, all links are working, and that it is clear for launch across browsers and devices.

**‚Ä∫ Launch:**

Once all bugs are identified and fixed, it's time for the big day. However, launching the website is not the end of the process. The website needs constant maintenance and some elements still might need fixing. Regularly updating the content, keeping up with the present trends of the industry, and adding new features even after the launch will ensure better engagement.

**¬ª What are the types of expert services required to build a website?**

**‚Ä∫ Research and Development:**

The first step to developing creative ideas is gathering the right information. Understanding a client‚Äôs requirements is the primary goal of the team. A list of design stages, their tasks, and the research is curated to select the right technology for the website design.

**‚Ä∫ Coding:**

Transforming a code into a well-developed design is a skill that requires technical expertise. Clean coding is a key element in the development of a responsive and professional web layout that is in line with your business goals.

**‚Ä∫ Expert Consulting:**

A good web developer with a vast knowledge of coding can turn any project around. Having a skilled personal managing the project improves the quality of the website and makes the process easier and efficient. Different software and strategies are involved in the design and redesign of websites.

**‚Ä∫ Launch and Maintenance:**

The real test of how well a website is built comes post-launch where regular updates, good content, and smooth functioning are of utmost value. Viewer analytics, UI/UX interface, de-bugging, and website maintenance are tested and optimized with top browsers to make your website an easy find.

### Web Development:

#### Before you Begin

**¬ª What to do before you start looking for a Web Development Company?**

**‚Ä∫ Know what you want:**

Hiring a web development agency without knowing what you want is as good as not hiring one. A website is a virtual platform that showcases your services, products, and other information for potential clients to know and contact you. Your platform should be user-friendly and a way forward for the smooth functioning of your organization. Evaluating a business structure, strategies, and the target audience is the first step to ordering a web solution.

**‚Ä∫ Smart Pockets:**

Each company quotes a different price for the same task. A web developer that charges less for the initial development may have higher costs for post-launch maintenance. While a web developer that charges more in the initial phases may charge less for the maintenance. Either way, a company with expertise, good resources, and commitment will give you the desired results. Compare quotations, customer service, and reviews of different web development agencies before you settle on one. Remember, it is crucial to focus on the quality of the product over the cost of it.

**‚Ä∫ Content:**

No two websites are the same and what makes them unique is their content. If you decide to write and create your content by yourself, beware that it will be a long and tiresome process. Keep ample time aside to invest in your content, and don‚Äôt forget to include things like FAQs, legal documents, and other paperwork. Hire a professional if that‚Äôs too much to do on your own. After all, a little help never hurt anyone.

**‚Ä∫ Old search engine rankings:**

‚ÄúError 404: Page not found-‚Äù An ordeal for visitors and a nightmare for business owners, this error pops up when search engines cannot locate a particular webpage. When the format of a website or a web app changes because of the website redesign, additional features, or shifting content, the search engine can lose the structure of your previous domain and subdomain. In such a scenario, you risk losing all your content. So double-check that your website development firm integrates 301 redirects to update search engine indices.

Elements like fonts, colors, backgrounds, menus, transitions, etc. are all developed by a front end developer. A good front end developer interprets their client‚Äôs ambition and translates it into a framework for the best user experience. They target potential obstacles and execute solutions to solve program issues. Some front-end languages and frameworks are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular.

**‚Ä∫ Back End:**

Focused on the ‚Äòinternal logic‚Äô, back end developers are equipped with the knowledge of the server, the application, and the database. These three objects are crucial to the proper functioning and communication of the web browser. Back end web developers prioritize the gathering and display of correct information. Some back-end languages and frameworks are PHP, Python, Java, and .NET.

**‚Ä∫ Full Stack:**

The best of both worlds, full-stack developers are fluent in both front-end and back-end development. They are experts in understanding, executing, and problem-solving in different fields that make a website.

**‚Ä∫ Target Platform:**

The platform where the website will run is the first step to selecting a web development language. All languages do not support all platforms, hence one must pick a language that caters to their target platforms. For instance, codes written in C language allow the platform to run on Windows and Linux based systems.

**‚Ä∫ Flexibility and Performance:**

While a language has its limitations, it must accommodate additional features and have a rapid speed with smooth function.

**‚Ä∫ Project Size:**

The scale of the project determines the size of the set of tools needed to solve the coding issues. As a client, one should evaluate their requirements, the project size, and opt for a language that offers a multitude of libraries and community support to tackle coding problems that may arise.

**‚Ä∫ Tool Support:**

For web development, it is a smart call to choose a tool-oriented language with a simple structure and a multitude of frameworks and libraries.

CMS updates, regular back-ups, and website maintenance are other key features required for the unhindered performance of your website that your agency must provide for.

#### Before you Begin

A web designer who gets you, is one you will give you what you want. A strong designer understands the know-how of the process and provides you with suggestions and solutions that may never have crossed your mind. It is a good practice to discuss with your designer their preferred mode and frequency of communication.

**5. Who supplies the images for the website?**

Visual Content is perhaps the most important part of any website design. Find out if the website design agency will provide photos for your website or you will have to generate that content. Stock images can be used once they‚Äôre paid for.

**6. Will I be able to review and approve the work as the project progresses?**

Both these factors vary based on the level of expertise, location, type of website, and industry.

**¬ª What are the factors that affect the cost and time taken by a web designing company?**

The biggest similarity between the two is that they both focus on web and website development as a whole. Both disciplines require some fundamental understanding of each other to carry out their work. Knowledge of programming languages, SEO, and CMS systems showcases the collaboration between the two skill areas.

**¬ª How do they affect the experience of your website?**

Together they create the entire experience for a website. The two skill areas stem from two different mindsets. A web developer will find it difficult to create an attractive web design. In the same way, a web designer faces challenges when it comes to logically constructing the layout for a website. Having stated that, website companies are one‚Äôs best bet to getting a good website as they provide their clients with the best from both worlds. A company also has other employees like graphic designers, programmers, and project managers to effectively manage the projects.

Like Alexa and Siri, voice search and instant answers will become a part of the website culture in the near future.

**¬ª Things to consider before choosing the dream website team of developers and designers**

**‚Ä∫ Front and backend development:**

Select a team with both front end and back end developers as they both have different tasks to perform. Having a team with just either one of them is like a half-baked cake.

**‚Ä∫ Not just one specialization:**

Select a web design and development agency which is fluent in multiple technologies and languages as they will deliver the solution best suited to your needs.

**‚Ä∫ Understanding the need for the project:**

It is important to pick a company that understands you and delivers more, if not the same as your expectations.

**‚Ä∫ Research and development:**

If research and development initiatives are the core value of the company, then it is the one you should go for.

**‚Ä∫ Flexibility:**

The number of revisions a web designing company predicts to have for your website will give you an idea of the caliber of the designers the company employs. It is also an estimate of the flexibility of the designers to change the design in case you don't like it.

**¬ª What to do once you hire a Website Development Company and web Design Company?**

Integration of the website development and website design is crucial to ensure that your vision for your website is turned into reality. Here are a few things you should do after the hiring process to ensure the smooth functioning of your project:

**‚Ä∫ Clarity and communication:**

Know exactly who is doing what. You are the bridge between your web development and design company so it is important to ensure that there is a clear division of labor and the cycle of coordination during website building is handled effectively. Finally, when it comes to integration, ensure that your web development company knows all the technical details of your design.

**‚Ä∫ Set review dates and follow them:**

Ask for updates on the process and ensure that the hired companies know exactly what is expected of them by the next review date. Be involved in the process and closely monitor the progress to avoid miscommunication. Set a flexible timeline and ensure that both projects are moving steadily.

**‚Ä∫ Be prepared:**

Pay on time to ensure that there is no delay from your side. Understand that some details are going to change based on implementation decisions. Accommodate for unexpected issues and have a working relationship between the companies and yourself to handle post-launch issues.**¬ª Why your organization should have a professional website?**

Websites are a key part of a company‚Äôs online presence strategy. It acts as a map that introduces the brand and helps users navigate through the features of the product, reviews on the company, and information on delivery and shipping. Today, open-source content management systems like WordPress have made it easy for anyone to create a website in no time. However, a business organization requires more than just that. Here is why you should invest resources in building a professional website:

**‚Ä∫ Credibility:**

Most consumers prefer to search for products and services on the internet before buying them. A professional website that shows up as soon as they enter the name of your company adds credibility to your brand and product. Without a website, your business might lose a competitive advantage as you have no platform to advertise your strengths.

**‚Ä∫ Cost and time effective:**

Despite the initial cost of designing and developing, a website generally costs less than any other promotional vehicle. It is easy to access and can reach a wide audience. An online catalog can provide lots of information about your product and save the time spent on explaining this to your customers one-on-one. Further, once your website is up and running, it is available indefinitely.

**‚Ä∫ Improve customer base and showcase your work:**

A website performs the dual function of developing customer-engagement while simultaneously advertising your product through portfolios, images, or testimonials. FAQ pages and newsletters can answer all your customers‚Äô questions and keep them up-to-date. What better way to go the extra mile than by sharing valuable and relevant information on your website.

**¬ª Why your organization must choose expert developers and designers to build your website?**

It is impossible to create a top-of-the-line and unique website with these so-called free website templates available online. A website represents the quality of your product and it is important to include images, headers, plugins, and code to ensure that your vision is turned into reality. Without a background in IT or programming, this will prove to be Greek and Latin. However, for professional web development companies, it is all second nature. Further, hiring a web design company will offer your users an attractive and dynamic website with the benefits of customization. The web designer will evaluate your business and products, and work with you towards your goal for the website. Search Engine Optimization techniques and the use of the latest technology for the development and maintenance of your website will make the growth of your business more probable. None of these benefits are offered by the basic cookie-cutter tools online. Thus, hiring a web design and development agency is crucial for the success of your website.

#### The Basics of Website Building:

**¬ª What are the elements required to build a website?**

**‚Ä∫ Navigation**

Easy to navigate web design and accessible menu items are important to ensure that the user always knows exactly where they are on the website. Site maps focused on functionality and interactive buttons are innovative ideas that can improve user experience.

**‚Ä∫ Content**

When it comes to websites, the content is king. Search Engine Optimization determines placement to ensure that your website reaches its maximum target audience. The content must be informative, easy to read, concise and engaging to create an effective website.

**‚Ä∫ Search**

A search tool is vital to ensure that users can quickly find the exact information they are looking for without having to comprehend complicated site maps.

**‚Ä∫ Accessibility**

Based on your target audience, it is important to ensure that your website is available both on desktop and mobile phones. It is also crucial to ensure that key information like contact details and product description is placed in an easily accessible area.

**‚Ä∫ Branding**

Visitors should immediately make a visual connection between your logo, print material, and your website. The website should represent your brand, contribute to the memorability of your branding, and enhance the image of your business.

**¬ª What are the steps for building a website?**

**‚Ä∫ Goal-setting:**

It is important to identify the aims and objectives behind the website. Is the website focused on the brand‚Äôs core message or a particular product with a specific focus? What are the personas of the target audience and the brand attributes? Competitor analysis and creative brief can be great tools to begin goal-setting.

**‚Ä∫ Identifying the scope:**

For the smooth functioning of the process of web development, it is important to collaborate with the experts and identify the core scope and functionalities. If the goal of the website gradually changes or expands through the process of development and design, not only will the final product be increasingly different from the original vision but with budget and time constraints, it will also, become unrealistic.

**‚Ä∫ Sitemap and Wireframe creation:**

A sitemap acts as a blueprint of your website and will give the designer a clear idea of the web architecture and the mutual relationship between the various pages and content elements. The next step is to build a mock-up of the wireframe in order to store the visual design and identify gaps. Balsamiq, Moqups, Sketch, and Axure are popular sitemap and wireframe creation tools used by professionals.

**‚Ä∫ Content and Designing:**

Curating engaging content both in terms of how it is written and how it is presented is the next crucial step. Attention catching phrases presented with the right structural elements serve best. Designing themes can begin with existing branding elements, color choices, and logos. High-quality designing can give a professional look while simultaneously increasing clicks, engagement, and revenue.

**‚Ä∫ Debugging:**

Once the development and designing are completed, it's time to test and debug. This involves ensuring that all pages of the website are loading, all links are working, and that it is clear for launch across browsers and devices.

**‚Ä∫ Launch:**

Once all bugs are identified and fixed, it's time for the big day. However, launching the website is not the end of the process. The website needs constant maintenance and some elements still might need fixing. Regularly updating the content, keeping up with the present trends of the industry, and adding new features even after the launch will ensure better engagement.

**¬ª What are the types of expert services required to build a website?**

**‚Ä∫ Research and Development:**

The first step to developing creative ideas is gathering the right information. Understanding a client‚Äôs requirements is the primary goal of the team. A list of design stages, their tasks, and the research is curated to select the right technology for the website design.

**‚Ä∫ Coding:**

Transforming a code into a well-developed design is a skill that requires technical expertise. Clean coding is a key element in the development of a responsive and professional web layout that is in line with your business goals.

**‚Ä∫ Expert Consulting:**

A good web developer with a vast knowledge of coding can turn any project around. Having a skilled personal managing the project improves the quality of the website and makes the process easier and efficient. Different software and strategies are involved in the design and redesign of websites.

**‚Ä∫ Launch and Maintenance:**

The real test of how well a website is built comes post-launch where regular updates, good content, and smooth functioning are of utmost value. Viewer analytics, UI/UX interface, de-bugging, and website maintenance are tested and optimized with top browsers to make your website an easy find.

### Web Development:

#### Before you Begin

**¬ª What to do before you start looking for a Web Development Company?**

**‚Ä∫ Know what you want:**

Hiring a web development agency without knowing what you want is as good as not hiring one. A website is a virtual platform that showcases your services, products, and other information for potential clients to know and contact you. Your platform should be user-friendly and a way forward for the smooth functioning of your organization. Evaluating a business structure, strategies, and the target audience is the first step to ordering a web solution.

**‚Ä∫ Smart Pockets:**

Each company quotes a different price for the same task. A web developer that charges less for the initial development may have higher costs for post-launch maintenance. While a web developer that charges more in the initial phases may charge less for the maintenance. Either way, a company with expertise, good resources, and commitment will give you the desired results. Compare quotations, customer service, and reviews of different web development agencies before you settle on one. Remember, it is crucial to focus on the quality of the product over the cost of it.

**‚Ä∫ Content:**

No two websites are the same and what makes them unique is their content. If you decide to write and create your content by yourself, beware that it will be a long and tiresome process. Keep ample time aside to invest in your content, and don‚Äôt forget to include things like FAQs, legal documents, and other paperwork. Hire a professional if that‚Äôs too much to do on your own. After all, a little help never hurt anyone.

**‚Ä∫ Old search engine rankings:**

‚ÄúError 404: Page not found-‚Äù An ordeal for visitors and a nightmare for business owners, this error pops up when search engines cannot locate a particular webpage. When the format of a website or a web app changes because of the website redesign, additional features, or shifting content, the search engine can lose the structure of your previous domain and subdomain. In such a scenario, you risk losing all your content. So double-check that your website development firm integrates 301 redirects to update search engine indices.

These three objects are crucial to the proper functioning and communication of the web browser. Back end web developers prioritize the gathering and display of correct information. Some back-end languages and frameworks are PHP, Python, Java, and .NET.

**‚Ä∫ Full Stack:**

The best of both worlds, full-stack developers are fluent in both front-end and back-end development.

**‚Ä∫ Target Platform:**

The platform where the website will run is the first step to selecting a web development language. All languages do not support all platforms, hence one must pick a language that caters to their target platforms. For instance, codes written in C language allow the platform to run on Windows and Linux based systems.

**‚Ä∫ Flexibility and Performance:**

While a language has its limitations, it must accommodate additional features and have a rapid speed with smooth function.

Meeting deadlines is crucial to any project. A good scale to measure the delivering capabilities of any web development services is the projected timeline of the project. The project duration will depend on factors like the scope, details, features, and issues that arise. The more complex your website is, the more time it will take.

**5. How will Do you handle hosting, security, and maintenance?**

While some firms choose to host their sites internally, most web development companies opt to have websites hosted by their web partners. Though this is popularly practiced, it is important for you to understand the implications of such an arrangement and figure out safety measures like Website Application Firewalls to protect your data. CMS updates, regular back-ups, and website maintenance are other key features required for the unhindered performance of your website that your agency must provide for.

**6. What‚Äôs included (and not included) in your price?**

**‚Ä∫ Experience:**

A web development firm has a direct impact on the project and thus, it is important to find someone who understands you. A web developer with experience in working for a business of your scale and type is better equipped to comprehend your goals and future ideas. An agency with less experience may not have a smooth ride while completing your project.

Reviews and referrals go a long way in establishing the credibility and the competency of a web development company. The more experience a developer has, the better his output quality ought to be. So set your expectations accordingly.

Choose platforms and programming languages that give you control over your content. Integration of Google Analytics, Hotjar, and other tools can help you tabulate traction, reviews, and reactions that a website receives from its audience.

**‚Ä∫ After Sales Support/ Ongoing Support:**

An organization that understands your immediate needs and helps you plan for the future is one with the most comprehensive outlook for your project. Before signing the contract, remember to ask about the support and services the web development company offers and the costs that it will incur. It would also help to gain a clear picture of website repair, security, and maintenance.

**‚Ä∫ Cost:**

It is often at costing that one draws the short stick. Many companies lose clientele because of their pricing. Some companies charge on an hourly basis while some have a monthly subscription. Get quotes from different agencies before settling on one. Choose a development company that doesn‚Äôt overcharge you and gives you the best of their services.

This requires a great understanding of coding that comes only with experience.

**‚Ä∫ Design style:**

Different individuals prefer different styles for their websites. Some prefer the same layout on all web pages, while some prefer different layouts on each webpage.

**‚Ä∫ SEO integration:**

### Web Designing:

#### Before you Begin

**¬ª What to do before you start looking for a web designing company?**

**‚Ä∫ Understand your project requirements:**

While the internet does have great ideas, it lacks the uniqueness that is specific to your brand. Assess your requirements and your goals to create an outline of what you need and what you want your website to deliver. This will help you estimate the logistics of the project and the type of team you need to hire.

**‚Ä∫ Design wish list:**

Many of the clients may not be designers, but every one of them has a vision for their website. One must curate these ideas and themes in a design checklist to accelerate the process. A website built from scratch and a website redesign are two different services with their respective necessities. You need to discern which service you need before going any further.

**‚Ä∫ Calculate a realistic project timeline:**

Estimating the timeline of the project is essential to selecting a team. A firm will save more time when compared to two-three freelancers. Discuss with your web design company regarding the type of availability of experts, communication, and meetings, the scope of delays, approvals, and other information to establish a realistic timeline for the project.

**‚Ä∫ Inquire about the net expenditure for the whole project:**

Having thought of a certain budget for your website prevents you from overspending. Like many businesses, a good web designing company is recognized by people for their work. Research on the prior undertakings of the company and view their finished product portfolios. Deduce a reasonable budget for the entire project from this research.

The browser width adaptation makes use of media-queries and breakpoints to switch between versions.

**‚Ä¢** **Pros:** You get what you see. Faster page speeds and flexibility.\
**‚Ä¢ Cons:** ‚ÄòDevice type‚Äô websites will appear broken in small browser windows. Limitation of certain effects.

**‚Ä∫ Responsive:**

Thus, the above list is formulated by experts based on data-oriented objective and subjective factors that affect your experience with a web design company to ensure that you don‚Äôt have to spend your valuable time surfing through countless websites.

#### Questions to ask before you hire a web design company:

**1. Do you have a portfolio?**

Many designers showcase their work portfolio on their websites. Review their work and decide if their style is similar to what you‚Äôve envisioned.

**2. What types of conversion strategies do you suggest?**

Website design is more than just aesthetics. It uses conversion strategies like lead magnets and pop-ups to generate the required user experience. Ask what strategies are recommended.

It is a good practice to discuss with your designer their preferred mode and frequency of communication.

**5. Who supplies the images for the website?**

Visual Content is perhaps the most important part of any website design. Find out if the website design agency will provide photos for your website or you will have to generate that content. Stock images can be used once they‚Äôre paid for.

**6. Will I be able to review and approve the work as the project progresses?**
