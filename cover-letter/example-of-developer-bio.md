# Example Of Developer Bio

I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that _delight_ and _inform_. I do it well.

I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The [list of projects I follow](http://github.com/mikewest/following) on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and [my Instapaper “Starred” list](http://www.instapaper.com/starred/rss/203164/fvc7FjLu4aIN5wsniOahrlWgbLw) will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.

### Professional Bio <a href="professional-bio" id="professional-bio"></a>

At the moment, I’m a developer advocate on Google’s Chrome team in Munich, Germany.

From January 2010 to November 2011, I was part of the team responsible for the web presence of one of the largest daily newspapers in Germany: [Sueddeutsche.de](http://www.sueddeutsche.de). It’s a big site, running on a surprisingly antiquated backend; we work hard to keep things running smoothly, and to meet the high expectations of our users. Generally, we did a pretty good job of it.

Before Sueddeutsche, I worked for Yahoo! on their equally massive European news sites. My team and I took `news.yahoo.com`’s solid codebase, and made it localizable for distinct markets and languages: we were directly responsible for building and maintaining Yahoo!’s news sites in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, relaunching all five within a year. We laid the foundation for further work that expanded the platform’s scope to include Singapore and beyond. We did _good_ work while understaffed and under pressure, and I’m proud of our accomplishments.

In addition to my in-house work, I’ve written a variety of articles on development for publications such as [DigitalWeb](http://www.digital-web.com/about/contributors/mike\_west/), [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/authors/w/mikewest), and Opera’s [Web Standards Curriculum](http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/). I enjoy what I do, and I enjoy sharing tidbits with others.

### Personal Bio <a href="personal-bio" id="personal-bio"></a>

A slight clarification of the above: I’m actually a philosophy student _cleverly disguised_ as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while reading Kant, I’ve focused my energies on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.

I moved to Germany from Texas a few years back, learned the language, and have settled in Munich for the time being. I think I’ll stick around here for a while…
