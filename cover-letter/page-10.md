To whom it may concern,

I would like to take this opportunity to express my interest in an \[] position at \[company name].

&#x20;

I have a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from TCNJ, and I am an exceedingly creative and passionate engineer. I genuinely enjoy and excel in interpersonal communication, and as such, in collaborative settings, I often assume a hybrid role between creative design and leadership.  I have an innate knack for solving and simplifying novel problems, as well as tinkering with electronics until my vision has materialized. I am confident my unique combination of skills, disposition and experience make me the ideal candidate to work with your team as a \[job title].

&#x20;

Creating and learning how to use tools to enhance my musical pursuits has been the most gratifying pursuit of my life. Establishing a career working with my greatest passions in music and technology is a path that I have been building towards for well over a decade. My interest in electronics began when I was eight, with countless experimentation kits my dad brought home for me after I fell in love with a snap circuit kit one of my elementary school teachers used to teach the class about electricity. Within a year, I was soldering together devices like FM radio receivers and tiny amplifier & speaker combos on PCB boards in my basement “laboratory”. As an electrical engineering major, I continued to advance my knowledge through developing musically inspired projects; to this day, I continue to obsess over the technology that makes modern recording possible.

&#x20;

In my collegiate career, I have concentrated my studies in digital signal analysis and processing. I developed the ability to implement DSP algorithms and make modifications based on my experiences as a multi-instrumentalist and audio technician. My course work has familiarized me with the design considerations that go into the development of: conventional analog filters, as well as recursive digital filters, along with the gauntlet of software tools used in the aid of designing and testing filters. I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to put engineering theory into practice as an audio tech, and participant in multiple recording projects throughout the years. Most recently I have been learning how to effectively record with multiple DAW applications, as well as coding for audio applications using the JavaScript Web API.

&#x20;

Please feel free to reach out to me using the adjacent contact information to schedule an interview. I look forward to speaking with you!

&#x20;

Sincerely, Bryan Guner
