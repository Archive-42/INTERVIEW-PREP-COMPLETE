### Job Boards and The Hunt

#### I can’t imagine the kind of masochism it would take to enjoy the act of posting and daily maintenance on a job board…It’s part of the process that you’ve already invested so much of yourself in, so you should take pride in it; do a good job the first time around and you’ll get where your going in the blink of an eye!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0\*mMGUyrh8xyfo0rv0.jpeg)### Update(After The Interview):

As a candidate, there are key next steps that you can and should after every interview to help you stand out.

**Send a thank you email within 24 business hours**

**Do not miss this step!** It takes less than five minutes and can make the difference between you and another candidate. It also keeps you fresh in your interviewers’ memories. For example:

‍

_Hi (name),_

> _Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to discuss my candidacy for (role title). After learning more about (share one or two takeaways from the interview about the company/team’s priorities), I’m even more excited to bring my skills in (1–3 relevant skills) to the team._

> _I look forward to hearing from you about next steps, and if there is anything that I can clarify about my experience or qualifications for the (role title) position, please don’t hesitate to reach out._

> _Thank you for your consideration,_

> _(your name)_

**Follow up**

Don’t wait for the company to reach out to you! Be proactive in showing your interest by checking in to see where you stand in the process. If a company indicates a deadline by which you will hear back, and the deadline has passed, follow-up!

**Check your email and phone regularly**\
**‍**\*\
\*Don’t ghost on a company at any stage in the process; make sure you add their domain to your safe senders list and respond to any messages within 24 hours.

‍

**Be prepared**\
**‍**\*\
\*You might be invited for another interview on short notice; review the description regularly so it doesn’t slip from your memory, and keep brushing up on skills you may need for an interview (chances are, this won’t be the only job you’ll need them for anyway!)

### Here are some networking email templates:

#### EMAIL NO. 1: SOMEONE YOU USED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH

Perhaps it’s your supervisor from your college internship. Or maybe it’s your favorite colleague from one of your previous jobs. Either way, nobody knows your skills and preferences better than the people you used to work side-by-side with–meaning they can be a huge help in your job search.

_Hey \[Name],_

_I hope you’re having a great week! I’ve been keeping up with you on LinkedIn, and it looks like things are going awesome with \[job or professional interest]._

_I’m getting in touch to let you know that I’m currently searching for a new opportunity in \[industry]. With my background in \[field] and skills in \[area], my ideal position involves \[detailed description of ideal job] for an employer who \[detailed description of ideal company]._

_Since we used to work so closely and I know you’re so well-connected, I’d love if you could let me know if you hear of any opportunities that you think I’d be a good fit for. I’ve attached my resume to this email, just in case that helps._

_Of course, I’m always willing to return the favor if you ever need._

_Thanks so much, \[Name]! I have so many fond memories of our time together at \[Company], and I hope things are even better for you since then._

_Best,_\
_\[Your Name]_

### EMAIL NO. 2: SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN YOUR DESIRED INDUSTRY

Sending a note to someone who is already employed in the field you’re eager to be a part of is always helpful, but especially when you’re making a career change. Chances are good that he or she is connected to other people in the industry–some of whom might even be hiring.

_Hello \[Name],_

_I hope you’re doing well!_

_I’m reaching out to let you know that I’ve decided to make a career change. Thus, I’m currently exploring different opportunities in \[industry]._

_Since I know you’ve worked in the industry for quite a while, I thought you’d be the perfect person to get in touch with. If you become aware of any open roles that might be a good fit for someone with a background in \[field], skills in \[area], and a desire to learn, I’d love if you could give me a heads up. You can also find my resume attached to this email to get a better understanding of what I bring to the table._

_I can’t tell you how much I appreciate any help as I work on making this switch._

_Thanks so much, \[Name]!_

_All the best,_\
_\[Your Name]_

#### First off I am going to introduce a few different categories for those of you who are completely overwhelmed by the prospect of even selecting a job board let alone establishing a competitive presence on one. Here’s a few catorizations I think are worth distinguishing for one and other.

### 1. Interpersonal Connections

Seek to leverage the connections you have with people you know and companies you want to work with. I know that that’s a violation of the premise of this article but without even feeling the need to provide quantitative proof; I can confidently assume that this is the most [RO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp)I efficient way to produce a desirable result. (Sorry introverts… 2020 may have been your year but this is our world. 😘)

**If personal connections don’t come through, the next best thing is cold outreach (**_**best in terms of results…. personally I hate cold calling strangers and I am an extrovert**_**.)**

1. Before or after submitting an application, **identify 1–3 professionals to reach out to** at the company to express interest in opportunities.
2. **Send a message to express interest and request an informational interview** with the individual via LinkedIn, email, Twitter, or other available communication methods.
3. **If you hear back** and the individual is willing to connect, **confirm a day and time to conduct a preliminary interview.** _OR_ **If you have yet to hear back after 3 business days, follow-up.**

Once you send off a message in step two, there are a variety of responses you may receive. Sometimes an individual will forward you along to someone who may be of better assistance, other times your message may be overlooked with no reply, and its possible (best case scenario) your request for a chat becomes an invitation to interview.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1\*3\_3Cb73SQM\_YazWGpZWtIw.png)![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1\*aI1PfkSpsUks598LAJvKoQ.png)![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1\*5eObFD9fV2fe5DztitZfsA.png)### \*\*\*2. LinkedIn\*\*\*.

I am going to devote a lot of time to this one because it is the largest and most active of all the job board ecosystems… period… full stop regardless of your industry.

LinkedIn now has [almost 740 million members](https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics) with over 55 million registered companies. (for comparison 12.3 million people visited Indeed in October, up 19.6 percent. [Monster.com](http://www.monster.com) attracted 12.1 million people, and [CareerBuilder.com](http://www.careerbuilder.com)attractedd 11.3 million in that same time) and LinkedIn is the most-used social media platform amongst Fortune 500 companies as it provides far more networking capabilities than pure recruitment.

If you put your resume and skills on LinkedIn.com as a software Engineer, and state that you are open to new opportunities, you _will_ be contacted by multiple recruiters, and if your skills are desirable possibly also directly by companies seeking to hire you. It’s a developer’s market; there’s not enough people out there, especially in America.

Here’s my profile… feel free to connect… the larger your network the greater your exposure is to someone who works at your potential dream job.

Here’s A Linkedin Checklist I will be using before I return to the job hunt!

[**LinkedIn**\
_Personal and Contact Information:_www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so/LinkedIn-d8b35e25ff0c451dbb5506ffa1179a8d)

> excerpt:

#### Experience Section

* \[ ] I **have** listed all professional roles included on my resume in this section and any that I had to cut from my resume for space
* \[ ] I **have** written 2–4 power statements for each experience listed (okay to copy and paste from resume)
* \[ ] My power statements for each experience [are bulleted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-how-add-bullet-points-your-linkedin-profile-erin-dore-miller/), not in paragraph form.
* \[ ] I **did** list responsibilities in bullet point format (I **did not** leave in paragraph format)
* \[ ] I **did** start each bullet point with [an action verb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZkDPBWtQZDGGdvStD61iRx\_jOWVlIyyQl9UOYHtZgA/edit?usp=sharing) and I **did not** use phrases such as: `Assisted with...` `Worked on...` `Helped with...` (`Solely responsible for...` ok)
* \[ ] I **did** describe past projects in past tense and current projects in present tense
* \[ ] I **did not** use pronouns such as: “I,” “we,” “they, “you,” “me,” “us”
* \[ ] **Optional:** Bootcamp student experience and projects can be listed under your experience section if you have no (or almost no) prior work experience.
* \[ ] If I listed my Bootcamp student experience, my title is \[name of program] Student (example: Data Science Student)
* \[ ] I copied and pasted my Lambda projects in my student description and also included them in the Accomplishments section

### Do’s:

**Spend a good portion of your time learning and reading. Your jobs teach you so much about an organization and the business.**

**Follow business owners and senior managers, successful team leaders in large organizations, startup owners. You would be surprised how willing some otherwise busy executives are to rub elbows with veritable newcomers. They’re not just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, just like you… they have an ulterior motive. They are hoping to build goodwill with the incoming workforce in a bid to make their company more attractive to high quality candidates. If they give you any of their time…treat it like an interview.**

> _To leverage this information, (the trick is to constantly remind yourself to be on your game with speaking with them.) I do not care what your teacher’s past have said… mark my words…_ _**THERE IS MOST CERTAINLY SUCH A THING AS A STUPID QUESTION**_\*…Anyone who tells you otherwise is either stupid themselves or just overcome with their own compassion (an admirable trait but ultimately a disservice to you the competitive job seeker).\*

[**How to Ask Great Questions**\
_In Brief The Problem Some professionals such as litigators, journalists and even doctors, are taught to ask questions…_hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions)

> Engage in networking. I would recommend **finding and connecting with current attendee of any software development bootcamp**. They’re all (for the most part) programatically encouraged to connect network and engage in peer skill promotion (even if they have no idea of you skill level). If that weren’t enough reason, all of them come from a cohort of other individuals being instructed to do the same. Once you have a few in your network other’s will seek you out through Linkedin recommendations algorithm.

> **Note to prospective employers please just skip the next few sentences and don’t ask why…😅**

> **Of the 214 people that vouched for me… I guestimate about only 80 actually know me in any respectable capacity, and of those, only probably 30 or so are familiar with my competency in the skills they endorsed. It all boils down to the strategies that bootcamps instill in their students. It’s the polar opposite of a zero sum game and they’re more than happy to exchange personal recommendations with you. They’re also far more driven to consistently engage with other members of the linkedin ecosystem because they need to a network to help compensate for their lack of a four year degree and the connections you make in that time.**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1\*E519LWHx8W3CXw6c5FXgqg.png)![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1\*AUDMmyZrugM3SSy\_0axgfQ.jpeg)

> Build your personal brand. Developing your brand will not only help you attract clients or recruits if you decide to start a business, but will also help you find great job opportunities. You can post anything you take pride in so long as it’s fairly professional. Definitely make use of the featured section to showcase your work.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1\*DlqWg94B670bgin5STdJNg.png)### Don’t:

#### Don’t Use LinkedIn’s Default Headline

LinkedIn automatically populates your headline with your current job title and company name. I hope it goes without saying… but as a rule avoid signaling to prospective employers the depths of your laziness by using any stock responses LinkedIn provides you.

#### Don’t Go Ham On Keyword Placment

Placing keywords strategically into your LinkedIn profile is virtually the only way to ensure being flagged by search algorithms as a potential candidate.You could be forgiven for being tempted to heed the advice of your inner lizard brain, and just stuffing your profile with buzzwords but this will likely trigger a spam account checker and result in worse outcomes than the absence of said keywords.

### Why it matters\*¿\*

#### Are We Really All Connected by Just Six Degrees of Separation?

Most of us are familiar with the concept of six degrees of separation — the idea is that anyone in the planet can be connected to anyone else in just six steps. So through just five other people, you’re effectively connected to the Queen of England, Jim Belushi or even yo mamma.

### Back to the other Job Board Niches:

_**3. Traditional job boards**_. Dice.com, Monster.com, etc. They will not find you great jobs at technology companies; they may find you openings as a software engineer at other types of more traditional companies (for example, banks, retail chains, etc though.

_**4. Local-focused sites**_. The biggest is Craigslist, but there are others. Often great for contract work and opportunities you wouldn’t have otherwise come across.

_**5. Freelancer websites**_. oDesk.com, Elance.com, etc. Lower pay, but 100% contract work, and has a lot of flexible opportunities if you’re not looking for traditional full-time employment or remote work.
