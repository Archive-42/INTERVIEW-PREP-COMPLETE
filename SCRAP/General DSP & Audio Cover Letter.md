|                       |   | I have a bachelor's degree in electrical |
|                       |   | engineering from TCNJ, and I am an       |

|                       |   | to enhance my musical pursuits has been  |
|                       |   | the most gratifying pursuit of my life.  |
|                       |   | Establishing a career working with my    |
|                       |   | greatest passions in music and           |
|                       |   | technology is a path that I have been    |
|                       |   | building towards for well over a decade. |
|                       |   | My interest in electronics began when I  |
|                       |   | was eight, with countless                |
|                       |   | experimentation kits my dad brought home |
|                       |   | for me after I fell in love with a snap  |
|                       |   | circuit kit one of my elementary school  |
|                       |   | teachers used to teach the class about   |
|                       |   | electricity. Within a year, I was        |
|                       |   | soldering together devices like FM radio |
|                       |   | receivers and tiny amplifier & speaker   |
|                       |   | combos on PCB boards in my basement      |
|                       |   | "laboratory". As an electrical           |
|                       |   | engineering major, I continued to        |
|                       |   | advance my knowledge through developing  |
|                       |   | musically inspired projects; to this     |
|                       |   | day, I continue to obsess over the       |
|                       |   | technology that makes modern recording   |
|                       |   | possible.                                |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | In my collegiate career, I have          |
|                       |   | concentrated my studies in digital       |
|                       |   | signal analysis and processing. I        |
|                       |   | developed the ability to implement DSP   |
|                       |   | algorithms and make modifications based  |
|                       |   | on my experiences as a                   |
|                       |   | multi-instrumentalist and audio          |
|                       |   | technician. My course work has           |
|                       |   | familiarized me with the design          |
|                       |   | considerations that go into the          |
|                       |   | development of: conventional analog      |
|                       |   | filters, as well as recursive digital    |
|                       |   | filters, along with the gauntlet of      |
|                       |   | software tools used in the aid of        |
|                       |   | designing and testing filters. I have    |
|                       |   | been fortunate enough to have had the    |
|                       |   | opportunity to put engineering theory    |
|                       |   | into practice as an audio tech, and      |
|                       |   | participant in multiple recording        |
|                       |   | projects throughout the years. Most      |
|                       |   | recently I have been learning how to     |
|                       |   | effectively record with multiple DAW     |
|                       |   | applications, as well as coding for      |
|                       |   | audio applications using the JavaScript  |
|                       |   | Web API.                                 |
|                       |   |                                          |
