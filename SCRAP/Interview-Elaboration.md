# sophisticated and fully customizable filtering to allow investors and real estate professionals to narrow in on exact search targets

-   I was responsible for creating webpages that could dynamically
    render views from any of the multitude of webpages based on a change
    in user state.

-   This was accomplished in part by css and html tricks that allowed
    sections of the html to appear hidden until a form submit event
    caused the execution of code that would reveal the hidden giving the
    appearance of Ajax without necessitating a http request for every
    end user action.

-   I also used a python module called beautiful soup in order to web
    scrape local listings from competing websites to supplement the
    listings stored in our database.

# Designed mock-up screens, wireframes, and workflows for intuitive user experience

-   Using a combination of visual design tools including (mostly Adobe
    XD) as well as draw.io and Google Web Designer. I created no
    responsive prototypes of page layouts to serve as a visual
    structural aid in discussions about the aesthetic and layout of
    site. Keep in mind this step while not actually programming is
    vitally important because you need to make the user's experience as
    pleasant as possible... if they are thinking about the fact that
    they are using your website than you have failed. Reducing click
    events and confusion is paramount.
