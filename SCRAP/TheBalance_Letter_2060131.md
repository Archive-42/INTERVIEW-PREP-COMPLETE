Dear Mr. Lee,

This letter is to express my interest in the job posted on your website
for an experienced, detailed-oriented, front-end web developer. As
you\'ll see, I have six years of hands-on experience efficiently coding
websites and applications using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Building state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites and
applications is truly a passion of mine and I am confident I would be an
excellent addition to your organization. In addition to my knowledge
base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on
industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of
the curve and deliver exceptional work to all of my employers, including
those I\'ve worked for on a project basis.

I've attached a copy of my resume detailing my experience, along with
links to websites and applications I've had the honor of working on.

I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, 555-555-5555 or by email at
<rita.applicant@gmail.com>.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking
with you about this opportunity.

Best regards,
