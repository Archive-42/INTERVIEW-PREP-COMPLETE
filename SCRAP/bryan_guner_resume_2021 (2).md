-   Implemented several Gatsby page models and GraphQL schema to fetch
    > markdown content and feed it into react components.

-   Designed and integrated a set of convenient web-hosted [developer
    > tools](https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/docs/tools/) and GUI
    > interfaces.

-   Successfully completed and delivered a platform to digitize a guitar
    > signal and perform filtering before executing frequency & time
    > domain analysis to track a current performance against
    > pre-recorded performance.

-   Implemented the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm in C++ and Python to
    > autonomously activate or adjust guitar effect at multiple
    > pre-designated sections of performance

-   Collaborated on state management using Redux to handle application
    > state and middleware using redux-promise & redux-thunk.

-   Built two graphic visuals of the user hierarchy and the scope of
    > their permissions.

-   Created Figma UI mockups of possible future developments, i.e.,
    > displaying metrics data and map pinpoint functionality.
