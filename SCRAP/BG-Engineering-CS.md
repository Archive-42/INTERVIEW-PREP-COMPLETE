|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | DSP, Hardware, Controls                  |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | To whom it may concern,                  |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | I would like to take this opportunity to |
|                       |   | express my interest in this position     |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | I have a bachelor's degree in electrical |
|                       |   | engineering from TCNJ, and I am an       |
|                       |   | exceedingly creative and passionate      |
|                       |   | engineer. I genuinely enjoy and excel in |
|                       |   | interpersonal communication, and as      |
|                       |   | such, in collaborative settings, I often |
|                       |   | assume a hybrid role between creative    |
|                       |   | design and leadership. I have an innate  |
|                       |   | knack for solving and simplifying novel  |
|                       |   | problems, as well as tinkering with      |
|                       |   | electronics until my vision has          |
|                       |   | materialized. I am confident my unique   |
|                       |   | combination of skills, disposition and   |
|                       |   | experience make me the ideal candidate   |
|                       |   | to work with your team.                  |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | Creating and learning how to use tools   |
|                       |   | to enhance my musical pursuits has been  |
|                       |   | the most gratifying pursuit of my life.  |
|                       |   | Establishing a career working with my    |
|                       |   | greatest passions in music and           |
|                       |   | technology is a path that I have been    |
|                       |   | building towards for well over a decade. |
|                       |   | My interest in electronics began when I  |
|                       |   | was eight, with countless                |
|                       |   | experimentation kits my dad brought home |
|                       |   | for me after I fell in love with a snap  |
|                       |   | circuit kit one of my elementary school  |
|                       |   | teachers used to teach the class about   |
|                       |   | electricity. Within a year, I was        |
|                       |   | soldering together devices like FM radio |
|                       |   | receivers and tiny amplifier & speaker   |
|                       |   | combos on PCB boards in my basement      |
|                       |   | "laboratory".                            |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | In my collegiate career, I have          |
|                       |   | concentrated my studies in digital       |
|                       |   | signal analysis and processing, as well  |
|                       |   | as controls systems. I developed the     |
|                       |   | ability to implement DSP algorithms and  |
|                       |   | make modifications based on my           |
|                       |   | experiences as a multi-instrumentalist   |
|                       |   | and audio technician. My course work has |
|                       |   | familiarized me with the design          |
|                       |   | considerations that go into the          |
|                       |   | development of: conventional analog      |
|                       |   | filters, as well as recursive digital    |
|                       |   | filters, along with the gauntlet of      |
|                       |   | software tools used in the aid of        |
|                       |   | designing and testing filters. My        |
|                       |   | greatest engineering assets are a strong |
|                       |   | mathematical foundation and a persistent |
|                       |   | proclivity for coming up with 'out of    |
|                       |   | the box' solutions to classical design   |
|                       |   | problems. In addition, my studies have   |
|                       |   | imparted a working knowledge of circuit  |
|                       |   | simulation and op-amp analysis, RF and   |
|                       |   | Microwave design, embedded systems and   |
|                       |   | control systems and perhaps most         |
|                       |   | importantly, the software and firmware   |
|                       |   | that enable modern electrical design and |
|                       |   | analysis. Most recently I have been      |
|                       |   | learning to code for audio applications  |
|                       |   | using the JavaScript Web API and         |
|                       |   | tinkering with a low latency arduino     |
|                       |   | controlled Bluetooth wireless guitar     |
|                       |   | transmitter using the pure data visual   |
|                       |   | programming language.                    |
|                       |   |                                          |
|                       |   | Please feel free to reach out to me      |
|                       |   | using the adjacent contact information   |
|                       |   | to schedule an interview. I look forward |
|                       |   | to speaking with you!                    |
