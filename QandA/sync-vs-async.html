<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>Synchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete.</p>
<p>Asynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it. However, asynchronous operations not part of the program (such as <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or <code>setTimeout</code>) are processed outside of the main thread because they are controlled by native code (browser APIs), but callbacks part of the program will still be executed synchronously.</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript has a concurrency model based on an "event loop".</li>
<li>Functions like <code>alert</code> block the main thread so that no user input is registered until the user closes it.</li>
</ul>
