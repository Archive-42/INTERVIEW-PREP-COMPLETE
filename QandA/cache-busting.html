        how can you achieve it?</h3>
    <h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
    <p>Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when
        switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser
        to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.</p>
    <p>However, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still
        references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and
        JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.</p>
    <p>Cache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file
        something different to the old file.</p>
    <p>A common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the
        file.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>src="js/script.js"</code> =&gt; <code>src="js/script.js?v=2"</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.</p>
