<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>4.5:1 is the calculated contrast ratio between foreground text and background that is recommended by the Web Content
  Accessibiity Guidelines (WCAG) success criteria (SC) 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum). This SC was written by the World Wide
  Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that people with low vision or color deficiencies are able to read (perceive) important
  content on a web page. It goes beyond color choices to ensure text stands out on the background it's placed on.</p>
