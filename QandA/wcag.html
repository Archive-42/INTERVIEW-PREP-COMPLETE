<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>WCAG stands for "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines". It is a standard describing how to make web content more
  accessible to people with disabilities They have 12-13 guidelines and for each one, there are testable success
  criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. The higher the level, the higher the impact on the design of the
  web content. The higher the level, the web content is essentially more accessible by more users. Depending on where
  you live/work, there may be regulations requiring websites to meet certain levels of compliance. For instance, in
  Ontario, Canada, beginning January 1, 2021 all public websites and web content posted after January 1, 2012 must meet
  AA compliance.</p>
