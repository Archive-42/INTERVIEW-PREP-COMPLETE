<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>A <code>Promise</code> is in one of these states:</p>
<ul>
<li>pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
<li>fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.</li>
<li>rejected: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these
  options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called.</p>
