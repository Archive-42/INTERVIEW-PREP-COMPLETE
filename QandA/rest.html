<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software design pattern for network architecture. A RESTful web application exposes data in the form of information about its resources.</p>
<p>Generally, this concept is used in web applications to manage state. With most applications, there is a common theme of reading, creating, updating, and destroying data. Data is modularized into separate tables like <code>posts</code>, <code>users</code>, <code>comments</code>, and a RESTful API exposes access to this data with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An identifier for the resource. This is known as the endpoint or URL for the resource.</li>
<li>The operation the server should perform on that resource in the form of an HTTP method or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of the URL and HTTP method with a <code>posts</code> resource:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading: <code>/posts/</code> =&gt; GET</li>
<li>Creating: <code>/posts/new</code> =&gt; POST</li>
<li>Updating: <code>/posts/:id</code> =&gt; PUT</li>
<li>Destroying: <code>/posts/:id</code> =&gt; DELETE</li>
</ul>
