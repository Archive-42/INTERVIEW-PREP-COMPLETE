<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>CSS preprocessors add useful functionality that native CSS does not have, and generally make CSS neater and more
  maintainable by enabling DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. Their terse syntax for nested selectors cuts down on
  repeated code. They provide variables for consistent theming (however, CSS variables have largely replaced this
  functionality) and additional tools like color functions (<code>lighten</code>, <code>darken</code>,
  <code>transparentize</code>, etc), mixins, and loops that make CSS more like a real programming language and gives the
  developer more power to generate complex CSS.</p>
