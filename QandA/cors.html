<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to grant a browser permission to access resources from a server at an origin different from the website origin.</p>
<p>An example of a cross-origin request is a web application served from <code>http://mydomain.com</code> that uses AJAX to make a request for <code>http://yourdomain.com</code>.</p>
<p>For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated by JavaScript. <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>fetch</code> follow the same-origin policy, meaning a web application using those APIs can only request HTTP resources from the same origin the application was accessed, unless the response from the other origin includes the correct CORS headers.</p>

<li>CORS behavior is not an error, â€Šit's a security mechanism to protect users.</li>
<li>CORS is designed to prevent a malicious website that a user may unintentionally visit from making a request to a legitimate website to read their personal data or perform actions against their will.</li>
