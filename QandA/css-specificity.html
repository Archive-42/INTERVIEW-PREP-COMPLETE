<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>Assuming the browser has already determined the set of rules for an element, each rule is assigned a matrix of values, which correspond to the following from highest to lowest specificity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline rules (binary - 1 or 0)</li>
<li>Number of id selectors</li>
<li>Number of class, pseudo-class and attribute selectors</li>
<li>Number of tags and pseudo-element selectors</li>
</ul>
<p>When two selectors are compared, the comparison is made on a per-column basis (e.g.Â an id selector will always be
  higher than any amount of class selectors, as ids have higher specificity than classes). In cases of equal specificity
  between multiple rules, the rules that comes last in the page's style sheet is deemed more specific and therefore
  applied to the element.</p>
