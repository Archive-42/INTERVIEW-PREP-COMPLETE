<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>A stateless component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state. Stateless components can be either
  functional or class components. Stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test since they are
  guaranteed to produce the same output given the same props. Stateless functional components should be preferred when
  lifecycle hooks don't need to be used.</p>
