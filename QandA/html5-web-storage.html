<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p>With HTML5, web pages can store data locally within the user's browser. The data is stored in name/value pairs, and a
  web page can only access data stored by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Differences between <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> regarding lifetime:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data stored through <code>localStorage</code> is permanent: it does not expire and remains stored on the user's
  computer until a web app deletes it or the user asks the browser to delete it.</li>
<li><code>sessionStorage</code> has the same lifetime as the top-level window or browser tab in which the data got stored. When the tab is permanently closed, any data stored through <code>sessionStorage</code> is deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Differences between <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> regarding storage scope:</strong> Both forms of storage are scoped to the document origin so that documents with different origins will never share the stored objects.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sessionStorage</code> is also scoped on a per-window basis. Two browser tabs with documents from the same origin have separate <code>sessionStorage</code> data.</li>
<li>Unlike in <code>localStorage</code>, the same scripts from the same origin can't access each other's
  <code>sessionStorage</code> when opened in different tabs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Earlier, this was done with cookies.</li>
<li>The storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) than with cookies and its faster.</li>
<li>The data is never transferred to the server and can only be used if the client specifically asks for it.</li>
</ul>
