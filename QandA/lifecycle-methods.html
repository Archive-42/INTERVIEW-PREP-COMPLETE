<h4 id="answer">Answer</h4>
<p><code>getDerivedStateFromProps</code>: Executed before rendering on the initial mount and all component updates. Used to update the state based on changes in props over time. Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.</p>
<p><code>componentDidMount</code>: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.</p>
<p><code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true.
  If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false
  value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new
  prop.</p>
<p><code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</code>: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before <code>componentDidUpdate</code>. Any value returned from this method will be passed to <code>componentDidUpdate</code>.</p>
<p><code>componentDidUpdate</code>: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.</p>
<p><code>componentWillUnmount</code>: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.</p>
<p><code>componentDidCatch</code>: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the <em>child</em> component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.</p>
