    <h4 id="how-does-react-work">How does React work?</h4>
    <p>
      React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly
      runs a “diffing” algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the
      virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM
      with the results of diff.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-react">
      What are the advantages of using React?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is easy to know how a component is rendered, you just need to look at
        the render function.
      </li>
      <li>
        JSX makes it easy to read the code of your components. It is also really
        easy to see the layout, or how components are plugged/combined with each
        other.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can render React on the server-side. This improves SEO and
        performance.
      </li>
      <li>It is easy to test.</li>
      <li>
        You can use React with any framework you wish as it is only a view
        layer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4
      id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-presentational-component-and-a-container-component"
    >
      What is the difference between a Presentational component and a Container
      component?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Presentational components are concerned with how things look. They
      generally receive data and callbacks exclusively via props. These
      components rarely have their own state, but when they do it generally
      concerns UI state, as opposed to data state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Container components are more concerned with how things work. These
      components provide the data and behavior to presentational or other
      container components. They define actions and provide these as callbacks
      to the presentational components. They are also often stateful as they
      serve as data sources.
    </p>
    <h4
      id="what-are-the-differences-between-a-class-component-and-functional-component"
    >
      What are the differences between a class component and functional
      component?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Class components allows you to use additional features such as local
          state and lifecycle hooks. Also, to enable your component to have
          direct access to your store and thus holds state.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When your component just receives props and renders them to the page,
          this is a ‘stateless component’, for which a pure function can be
          used. These are also called dumb components or presentational
          components.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props">
      What is the difference between state and props?
    </h4>
    <p>
      State is a data structure that starts with a default value when a
      Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of
      user events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Props (short for properties) are a Component’s configuration. They are
      received from above and immutable as far as the Component receiving them
      is concerned. A Component cannot change its props, but it is responsible
      for putting together the props of its child Components. Props do not have
      to just be data - callback functions may be passed in as props.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-are-the-different-lifecycle-methods">
      What are the different lifecycle methods?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>componentWillMount</code> (deprecated) - this is most commonly
        used for App configuration in your root component.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>componentDidMount</code> - here you want to do all the setup you
        couldn’t do without a DOM, and start getting all the data you need. Also
        if you want to set up eventListeners etc. this lifecycle hook is a good
        place to do that.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> (deprecated) - this lifecyclye
        acts on particular prop changes to trigger state transitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> - if you’re worried about wasted
        renders <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> is a great place to improve
        performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives
        new <code>prop</code>. <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> should always
        return a boolean and based on what this is will determine if the
        component is rerendered or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>componentWillUpdate</code> (deprecated) - rarely used. It can be
        used instead of <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> on a component
        that also has <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> (but no access to
        previous props).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>componentDidUpdate</code> - also commonly used to update the DOM
        in response to prop or state changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>componentWillUnmount</code> - enables you can cancel any outgoing
        network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the
        component.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="react-hooks">React Hooks</h4>
    <p>
      Hooks let you use more of React’s features without having to use classes.
      The first hook that you will most likely encounter is
      <code>useState</code>. <code>useState</code> is a Hook that lets you add
      React state to function components. It returns an array with a getter and
      a setter. The syntax looks like
      <code>const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);</code>. The equivalent
      when using a class component would be.
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode js"
      ><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="at">state</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">count</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3"><span class="op">};</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" title="5"><span class="op">&lt;</span>button onClick<span class="op">={</span>() <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="at">setState</span>(<span class="op">{</span> <span class="dt">count</span><span class="op">:</span> <span class="kw">this</span>.<span class="va">state</span>.<span class="at">count</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">}</span>)<span class="op">}&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" title="6">  Increase Count</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" title="7">&lt;/button<span class="op">&gt;;</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      The next hook you will most likely encounter is <code>useEffect</code>.
      The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. By
      passing an empty array as the second argument to <code>useEffect</code> is
      equivalent to using <code>componentDidMount</code>. If you pass a value to
      the array it will only call the <code>useEffect</code> function when the
      value in the array updates.
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode js"
      ><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="at">useEffect</span>(() <span class="kw">=&gt;</span> <span class="op">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">  <span class="co">// do stuff when the component mounts</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="op">},</span> [])<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <h4 id="where-in-a-react-component-should-you-make-an-ajax-request">
      Where in a React component should you make an AJAX request?
    </h4>
    <p>
      <code>componentDidMount</code> is where an AJAX request should be made in
      a React component. This method will be executed when the component
      “mounts” (is added to the DOM) for the first time. This method is only
      executed once during the component’s life. Importantly, you can’t
      guarantee the AJAX request will have resolved before the component mounts.
      If it doesn’t, that would mean that you’d be trying to setState on an
      unmounted component, which would not work. Making your AJAX request in
      <code>componentDidMount</code> will guarantee that there is a component to
      update.

      In HTML, form elements such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> typically
      maintain their own state and update it based on user input. When a user
      submits a form the values from the aforementioned elements are sent with
      the form. With React it works differently. The component containing the
      form will keep track of the value of the input in it’s state and will
      re-render the component each time the callback function e.g. <code
        >onChange</code
      >
      is fired as the state will be updated. An input form element whose value
      is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

    <h4 id="what-are-refs-used-for-in-react">
      What are refs used for in React?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Refs are used to get reference to a DOM node or an instance of a component
      in React. Good examples of when to use refs are for managing focus/text
      selection, triggering imperative animations, or integrating with
      third-party DOM libraries. You should avoid using string refs and inline
      ref callbacks. Callback refs are advised by React.

    <h4 id="what-is-a-higher-order-component">
      What is a higher order component?
    </h4>
    <p>
      A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns
      a new component. HOC’s allow you to reuse code, logic and bootstrap
      abstraction. The most common is probably Redux’s
      <code>connect</code> function. Beyond simply sharing utility libraries and
      simple composition, HOCs are the best way to share behavior between React
      Components. If you find yourself writing a lot of code in different places
      that does the same thing, you may be able to refactor that code into a
      reusable HOC.

    <h4 id="what-advantages-are-there-in-using-arrow-functions">
      What advantages are there in using arrow functions?
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scope safety: Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own
        this value (a new object in the case of a constructor, undefined in
        strict mode function calls, the base object if the function is called as
        an “object method”, etc.). An arrow function does not create its own
        this, the this value of the enclosing execution context is used.
      </li>
      <li>Compactness: Arrow functions are easier to read and write.</li>
      <li>
        Clarity: When almost everything is an arrow function, any regular
        function immediately sticks out for defining the scope. A developer can
        always look up the next-higher function statement to see what the Object
        is.
      </li>

      Why is it advised to pass a callback function to setState as opposed to an
      object?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Because <code>this.props</code> and <code>this.state</code> may be updated
      asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the
      next state.

    <h4 id="what-is-the-alternative-of-binding-this-in-the-constructor">
      What is the alternative of binding <code>this</code> in the constructor?
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can use property initializers to correctly bind callbacks. This is
      enabled by default in create react app. you can use an arrow function in
      the callback. The problem here is that a new callback is created each time
      the component renders.
    </p>
    <h4 id="how-would-you-prevent-a-component-from-rendering">
      How would you prevent a component from rendering?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Returning null from a component’s render method means nothing will be
      displayed, but it does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the amount of times the component re-renders is an issue, there are two
      options available. Manually implementing a check in the
      <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> lifecycle method hook.
    </p>
    <pre><code>shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState){
  // Do some check here
  return resultOFCheckAsBoolean
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Or using React.PureComponent instead of React.Component
      React.PureComponent implements <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> with a
      shallow prop and state comparison. This enables you to avoid re-rendering
      the component with the same props and state.

      When rendering a list what is a key and what is it’s purpose?
    </h4>
    <p>
      Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are
      removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the
      elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string
      that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you
      would use IDs from your data as keys. When you don’t have stable IDs for
      rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort. It
      is not recommend to use indexes for keys if the items can reorder, as that
      would be slow.

    <h4 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-superprops">
      What is the purpose of super(props)?
    </h4>
    <p>
      A child class constructor cannot make use of <code>this</code> until
      <code>super()</code> has been called. Also, ES2015 class constructors have
      to call <code>super()</code> if they are subclasses. The reason for
      passing <code>props</code> to <code>super()</code> is to enable you to
      access <code>this.props</code> in the constructor.

    <h4 id="what-is-jsx">What is JSX?</h4>
    <p>
      JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and comes with the full power of
      JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”. You can embed any JavaScript
      expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. After compilation, JSX
      expressions become regular JavaScript objects. This means that you can use
      JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept
      it as arguments, and return it from functions:

  &lt;/h1&gt;
);</code></pre>
    <p>Answer:</p>
    <pre><code>const element = React.createElement(

    <h4 id="what-is-children">What is <code>Children</code>?</h4>
    <p>
      In JSX expressions that contain both an opening tag and a closing tag, the
      content between those tags is passed to components automatically as a
      special prop: <code>props.children</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this
      <code>prop</code>. These include <code>React.Children.map</code>,
      <code>React.Children.forEach</code>, <code>React.Children.count</code>,
      <code>React.Children.only</code>, <code>React.Children.toArray</code>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-is-state-in-react">What is state in react?</h4>
    <p>
      State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the
      component. State is essentially an object that holds data and determines
      how the component renders and behaves.

    <h4 id="what-is-redux">What is redux?</h4>
    <p>
      The basic idea of redux is that the entire application state is kept in a
      single store. The store is simply a javascript object. The only way to
      change the state is by sending actions from your application and then
      writing reducers for these actions that modify the state. The entire state
      transition is kept inside reducers and should not have any side-effects.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-is-a-store-in-redux">What is a store in redux?</h4>
    <p>
      The store is a javascript object that holds application state. Along with
      this it also has the following responsibilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows access to state via <code>getState()</code>;</li>
      <li>Allows state to be updated via <code>dispatch(action)</code>;</li>
      <li>Registers listeners via <code>subscribe(listener)</code>;</li>
      <li>
        Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by
        <code>subscribe(listener)</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="what-is-an-action">What is an action?</h4>
    <p>
      Actions are plain javascript objects. They must have a type indicating the
      type of action being performed. In essence, actions are payloads of
      information that send data from your application to your store.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-is-a-reducer">What is a reducer?</h4>
    <p>
      A reducer is simply a pure function that takes the previous state and an
      action, and returns the next state.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-is-redux-thunk-used-for">What is Redux Thunk used for?</h4>
    <p>
      Redux thunk is middleware that allows you to write action creators that
      return a function instead of an action. The thunk can then be used to
      delay the dispatch of an action if a certain condition is met. This allows
      you to handle the asynchronous dispatching of actions.
    </p>
    <h4 id="what-is-a-pure-function">What is a pure function?</h4>
    <p>
      A pure function is a function that doesn’t depend on and doesn’t modify
      the states of variables out of its scope. Essentially, this means that a
      pure function will always return the same result given same parameters.
