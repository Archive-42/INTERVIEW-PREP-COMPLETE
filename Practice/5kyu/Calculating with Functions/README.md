# Calculating with Functions

## Description

This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

## Example

```js
seven(times(five())) // must return 35
four(plus(nine())) // must return 13
eight(minus(three())) // must return 5
six(dividedBy(two())) // must return 3
```
