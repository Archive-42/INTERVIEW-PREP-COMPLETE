Notes:

* _Web_ covers the usual front-end skills, _Mobile_ usually means iOS and Android, and _DevOps_ is listed for companies where this is one of the main focus areas.
* Globally-competitive compensation means that the company doesn't use remote workers as a source of cheap labour. For compensation to be globally competitive, the company should offer packages that are comparable to market rates in major tech hubs.
