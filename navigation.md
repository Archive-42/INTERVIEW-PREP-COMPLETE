### Weekly Job Search Expectations: 🔟-🔟-🔟

On a weekly basis, you're aiming for 10-10-10: 10 quality applications, 10 outreach messages, and 10 technical skill-building activities or hours. Track your weekly progress against these goals with the [Lambda Careers Site](https://careers.lambdaschool.com).

* \[ ] **Submit 10 quality applications and track them in **[**Job Tracker**](https://careers.lambdaschool.com/jobtracker)**.**
  * **What is a quality application?**
    * 👋🏽 You have reached out via [email or LinkedIn](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Outreach-101-9b887ce51ecc4a58bc972415fcf6e934) to at least 1 person at the company. [Cold Outreach 101](https://www.notion.so/Cold-Outreach-101-9b887ce51ecc4a58bc972415fcf6e934) has great LinkedIn and email outreach templates. Use [Clearbit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo?hl=en) or [hunter.io](http://hunter.io) to find their email address (email is preferable to LinkedIn).
    * 🆕 The job has been posted within the last 2 weeks\*\*,\*\* prioritizing jobs posted in the last 24-48 hours!
    * 🤓 The job requires 0-5 years of experience
    * 💻 You have applied through the company website, not an easy-apply portal.
    * 📜 You have skipped the [cover letter](https://www.notion.so/Cover-Letters-57659b80226442c2accd2a4895e1b950), unless it is explicitly required.
* \[ ] **Reach out to 10 people every week and track them in **[**Lambda Careers**](https://careers.lambdaschool.com)**.**
  * **Who should I reach out to?**
    * 👩🏾‍💻 An employee at a prospective company (any engineering, data science, or product position). Bonus points if they are the manager for your desire team, or future boss.
    * 👩‍🔧 A bootcamp alum or anyone with a non-traditional background working at a company you're interested
    * 👨🏼‍🎓 A Lambda School alum who is employed at a prospective employer
    * 📥 An internal recruiter at a prospective company
    * 👯‍♀️ A warm contact who can offer advice or a referral
* \[ ] **Complete 10 technical skill building (or maintenance) activities**
  * **How do I practice Code Challenges?**

    * We encourage you to take the [CodeSignal GCA](https://app.codesignal.com/signup?certifiedInvite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) every two weeks. Your most updated score will be saved and we'll use it to refer you to the right partner opportunities.
